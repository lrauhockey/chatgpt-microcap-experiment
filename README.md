# AI-Powered Portfolio Management System

A comprehensive Python Flask web application that combines real-time stock data, AI-powered trading recommendations, automated portfolio management, and performance tracking. Features include intelligent stock analysis, automated trading execution, and advanced portfolio monitoring.

Note: this is not an offer to buy or sell stock. This is was built as an experiment to see if ChatGPT could trade or not.  
I don't endorse anyone using this to manage thier portfolo. It is a good example of testing out some APIs including Open AI API
Please invest with a professional!   This does not represent my current, past or future employment. 
All the code was written by AI (incluing the prompt to AI ) as this was also used as a demo to how to vibe code a system. 
This was in response to https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment trading success.
